  "faq.items": [
    {
      "question": "How can I recognise good hay?",
      "answer": "Good hay can be recognised by its colour, the composition of the grasses, the smell and any signs of poor storage or exposure to rain or water ingress — also obvious indicators like visible weeds or turf. Important: poor-quality hay should not be used because mould spores can develop."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why do bale prices vary so much?",
      "answer": "Prices depend on the desired quality (straw for bedding or feeding), the format (round or square, special sizes) and the condition (long, chopped or shredded); suitability for the intended use plays a major role."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I determine the nutritional content of hay?",
      "answer": "In general, the exact nutritional content of hay can only be determined by laboratory analysis. Green hay does not necessarily provide more energy than brown hay — this depends strongly on species and location. Colour mainly reflects carotene content and the condition of the outer layer."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I recognise good straw?",
      "answer": "Straw quality is judged by its colour (golden or rather greyish), smell, storage conditions and exposure to weather like rain or water ingress. Visible weeds and reddish-brown discoloration on the outside are clear signs of poor quality."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which hay is best for horses?",
      "answer": "Structurally rich hay with a higher stem-to-leaf ratio is best for horses. Preferably use the first cut of the hay harvest for horses; mowing is timed to suit horse feeding."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which straw do horses/cattle prefer?",
      "answer": "Horses seldom receive straw as a fibre supplement, but they tend to prefer wheat and barley straw. For cattle, straw should be short because long stems often remain in mixed rations."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does hay keep?",
      "answer": "If stored without compromise, hay keeps for about one year. With longer storage hay ages and nutrients and vitamins degrade. Over-aged hay should generally not be fed to horses."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can straw go bad?",
      "answer": "If straw is stored properly so that no water can penetrate the bales, it can remain usable for several years."
    },
    {
      "question": "How should hay be stored?",
      "answer": "Ideally, store hay under a roof with walls. If there are no walls, at least close off the exposed sides so weather cannot reach the hay. Also ensure moisture from the ground does not wick into the hay."
    },
    {
      "question": "How much straw does a horse need per month?",
      "answer": "That depends on the horse's hay feeding. If roughage is freely available, additional straw supplementation is usually not necessary."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why don't you offer silage?",
      "answer": "Haylage and silage are sensitive products. With horses there is a risk of loose droppings and, in improperly stored material, the formation of harmful substances. To avoid these risks we refrain from offering haylage and silage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the best way to store straw?",
      "answer": "Ideally store straw under a roof; if there are no walls, at least close the weather-exposed sides to protect it. Also ensure moisture does not rise from the ground into the straw."
